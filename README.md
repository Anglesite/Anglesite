# @DWK

This is a directory for my `@dwk/` node modules.

## AI Setup

- TypeScript
- Jest @ 90% coverage
- Linting: Typescript/JavaScript, YAML, Markdown, HTML, CSS

## Vibing with Claude

Tell User Stories for new features. Show ad hoc wireframes from Freeform.

Pre-commit:

```text
1. Remove all code obsoleted by the changes since the last commit and any leftover debug logging.
2. Update existing tests for changed code.
3. Ensure we have 90% test coverage on the new code.
4. Check and fix any linting errors.
5. Add all changes and summarize them into a commit message for me to approve.
```

Double check linting and tests. Spot check changes in app.

üëç Commit & push.

### Phase 2: Remaining Work (60% incomplete)

üî¥ Critical Blockers (Fix First)

1. Missing Dependencies - Install @rjsf/\* packages to fix WebsiteConfigEditor
2. No File Editors - Zero WYSIWYG editors implemented (core Phase 2 feature)

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance tools
- Built-in accessibility auditing

  üîß Technical Gaps

  State Management:

- Expand React Context for file editing state
- Add undo/redo functionality
- Implement draft saving

  Integration:

- Make React editor primary (not fallback)
- Complete IPC handlers for file operations
- Add real-time preview sync

  üìä Current Status: 40% Complete
